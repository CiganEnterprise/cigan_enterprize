# CiganEnterprize

This webapp represents the concept of a business focused on digital solutions with lots of functionalities
and subsystems who are very well automated.

 ## Backend

In the backend I have 9 databases each of them being strong related to a subsystem automated in the webapp.
I have also integrated the CRM plugin ( more details here -> ... ) for managing the clients and the projects
the company is working at. Excluding the databases included by the CRM, there are 5 databases.
* BLOG which includes only one table: Posts
* MAINCOMPONENT which includes three tables: Employers, Projects, Studios.
* EVENTS which includes three tables: Host events, Past Events, Sponsor Events
* COMMUNICATION which includes two tables: Contact and Newsletter
* CAREERS which includes four tables: AvailableInternships, AvailableJobs, InternshipsAppliance, JobsAppliance 

A part of the databases can be seen below.

##### BLOG

The Posts table from the Blog Database includes all the articles which can be seen in the platform
at the company blog section. From this part of the administration system you can actualise, 
change or write articles very easy through a basic form.
