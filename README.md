# CiganEnterprize

This webapp represents the concept of a business focused on digital solutions with lots of functionalities
and subsystems who are very well automated.

 ## Backend

In the backend I have 9 databases each of them being strong related to a subsystem automated in the webapp.
I have also integrated the CRM plugin ( more details here -> ... ) for managing the clients and the projects
the company is working at. Excluding the databases included by the CRM, there are 5 databases.
* MAINCOMPONENT which includes three tables: Employers, Projects, Studios.
* EVENTS which includes three tables: Host events, Past Events, Sponsor Events
* COMMUNICATION which includes two tables: Contact and Newsletter
* CAREERS which includes four tables: AvailableInternships, AvailableJobs, InternshipsAppliance, JobsAppliance 

A part of the databases can be seen below.
